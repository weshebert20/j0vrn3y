## IDEA

I originally planned the idea to stretch my knowledge on front-end and front-end libraries. I am a photographer and wanted to use my photographs to tell a sort of story. As the idea evolved, one of my favorite songs was on and I realized the photos I have been coding with fit the lyrics. Ultimately I am really happy with how the idea evolved and I got to showcase some of my photos and front end skills.
